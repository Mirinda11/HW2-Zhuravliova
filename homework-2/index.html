            A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of aerospace
            engineering and
            scientific proposals <span class="bold">since the late 1940s</span>. Plans include landing on Mars for
            exploration at
            a
            minimum, with some
            considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and
            starting
            terraforming of the planet.

            Exploration of Mars
        </h3>
        <p class="pi">
            The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Conceptual work for
            missions
            that would
            involve human explorers has been ongoing since the 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated
            as
            taking place
            anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of crewed Mars mission plans
            shows
            the various
            mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of
            space
            exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and
            eight
            astronauts)
            would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research
            stations,
            colonization or other continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic
            technologies, have
            also been proposed.

            <em>In the 2010s</em>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human
            missions to
            Mars.[citation
            needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels,
            and
            films.
